# Transcription & OCR Proposal: Digital Manuscript and Artifact Transcription via AI-OCR

## I. Executive Summary: The Convergence of AI, FaithTech, and National Preservation

MZHub proposes a high-fidelity, scalable solution for the automated transcription of endangered cultural and religious manuscripts and artifacts. This service, titled Digital Manuscript and Artifact Transcription (AI-OCR), addresses a critical national and global imperative: the rapid transformation of fragile, image-based historical texts into durable, machine-readable, and interoperable digital archives.<sup>1</sup> The proposed framework leverages advanced Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) technology within the Microsoft Azure ecosystem, establishing a highly efficient serverless pipeline tailored for the unique challenges posed by low-resource and archaic scripts prevalent in Indian heritage.

The foundation of the MZHub service is the deployment of **Azure Document Intelligence Custom Neural Models (V4.0)**. These deep learning systems are essential for accurately navigating the non-standard typography and evolving orthographic conventions that render traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems ineffective for historical corpora.<sup>3</sup>

Strategically, the project is designed for explicit compliance with the rigorous standards of the Government of India (GoI), specifically aligning with the directives of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the National Digital Preservation Program (NDPP). By integrating Azure Immutable Blob Storage with Write Once, Read Many (WORM) policies, the architecture inherently meets institutional cultural archiving requirements for non-erasable, non-modifiable e-records.<sup>5</sup>

The request for \$150,000 in Microsoft Azure credits is justified by the need to accelerate the crucial Phase 1 infrastructure setup and the intensive data preparation required for fine-tuning the specialized neural models. The resultant serverless architecture, primarily utilizing Azure Functions, is projected to yield superior operational efficiency, demonstrating up to a 75% reduction in cost per document processed compared to conventional virtual machine (VM)-based environments.<sup>8</sup> This technical architecture ensures sustainability and long-term fiscal viability essential for national digital infrastructure projects.

## II. The FaithTech Mandate: Crisis in Digital Heritage Transcription

The preservation of cultural heritage hinges upon the successful digitization and transcription of ancient artifacts and manuscripts, which house critical understandings of past civilizations and trace the lineage of modern culture, including political, economic, and religious dimensions.<sup>1</sup> Digital tools, including computer vision and Artificial Intelligence, have become indispensable for creating high-resolution digital archives and enhancing research capabilities for historians and linguists.<sup>2</sup>

### A. The Crisis of Digital Heritage Preservation

India's cultural legacy, often stored in fragile artifacts and faded inscriptions, faces dual threats of physical decay and digital obsolescence. The transformation of these resources into principal digital assets requires robust, automated recognition and processing capabilities to enable the large-scale interpretation of historical scripts.<sup>1</sup>

### B. The Low-Resource and Archaic Script Barrier

MZHub specifically targets the transcription gap left by generic commercial OCR, which struggles profoundly with scripts characterized by low-resource status and high linguistic complexity.<sup>10</sup> The diversity of ancient scripts is substantial, encompassing Phonographic scripts like Sanskrit and Latin, and Logographic systems such as Egyptian Hieroglyphs.<sup>1</sup> Within the context of Indian FaithTech, this challenge is compounded by the numerous regional languages and evolutionary script variants that lack the comprehensive linguistic resources necessary to train robust, generic algorithms.<sup>10</sup>

#### The Non-Standard Orthography Problem

The primary technical barrier is that historical documents rarely conform to modern printing standards. They frequently feature non-standard typography, archaic grammatical forms, and evolving orthographic conventions.<sup>3</sup> For instance, conventional OCR algorithms, developed for modern machine-readable text, cannot effectively handle challenges like those found in 18th-century texts, which exhibit unique orthographic elements and syntax.<sup>3</sup>

A critical methodological deficiency in applying foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) to digital humanities is the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics. Standard metrics like Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) measure substitution, insertion, and deletion errors but fundamentally fail to capture deeper, context-specific LLM behaviors.<sup>3</sup> These failures include the systematic insertion of anachronistic elements or **temporal conflation**, where a model incorrectly applies orthographic features from a different historical period.<sup>3</sup>

If a transcription service relies only on these surface-level metrics, the results, while quantitatively "accurate," will be contextually unreliable for scholarly research. To ensure true preservation fidelity, the proposed system must incorporate a **Custom Orthographic Validation Layer**. This layer, integrated into the post-processing pipeline, must be specifically designed to track and flag deviations from established historical or dialectal norms. This approach elevates the project beyond mere data extraction, committing the service to the advanced linguistic preservation required by digital humanities researchers.

Furthermore, leveraging base models trained on massive, proprietary datasets carries the inherent risk of **training data contamination**, where evaluation texts may have been included in the LLM's pretraining corpora, thereby undermining the validity of traditional benchmarking.<sup>3</sup> To mitigate this significant methodological flaw, MZHub explicitly details a validation process that emphasizes unique orthographic features highly unlikely to be present in common pre-training data. This rigorous approach is necessary to establish academic credibility and ensure that performance claims are based on genuine model adaptation, not prior exposure.

## III. Technical Architecture: Azure IDP Cloud Stack for Resilient Transcription

The MZHub solution is a state-of-the-art, event-driven Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) pipeline engineered entirely on the Microsoft Azure platform, ensuring high performance, elasticity, and unwavering data integrity.

### A. Core IDP Engine: Azure Document Intelligence

The pipeline's core recognition engine is Azure Document Intelligence (formerly Form Recognizer), a Foundry Tool that applies advanced AI models to extract text, key-value pairs, tables, and structures from documents automatically and accurately.<sup>13</sup> Document Intelligence utilizes a high-definition OCR engine tailored specifically for documents, enabling it to extract complex structural elements, including text, tables (with row and column numbers), and selection marks.<sup>13</sup>

#### Mandate for Custom Neural Models (V4.0)

Given the highly irregular nature of manuscript data, MZHub mandates the use of the **Document Intelligence Custom Neural Model (V4.0)**.<sup>4</sup> Unlike custom template models, neural models leverage deep learning and a robust base model fine-tuned or adapted to specific data.<sup>4</sup>

The choice of Custom Neural Models is critical because they support extracting key data fields from unstructured and semi-structured documents, which accurately describes the heterogeneity of historical manuscripts.<sup>4</sup> This capability overcomes the limitations of generic OCR systems. Furthermore, the platform's minimum requirement of only five labeled examples to initiate custom model training enables rapid iteration and specialization on specific, low-resource script variants, making the technology uniquely suited for this domain.<sup>4</sup> The final output is returned as structured JSON, simplifying downstream cataloging and database integration.<sup>4</sup>

### B. Serverless and Event-Driven Processing Pipeline

The architecture employs a serverless, Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model, which abstracts all infrastructure management (provisioning, scaling, maintenance) away from developers, allowing them to focus solely on code logic.<sup>16</sup>

#### Ingestion and Archival Layer (Azure Blob Storage)

Digitized images (e.g., TIF, PDF) are ingested and securely stored in Azure Blob Storage.<sup>17</sup> The most significant feature of this layer is the mandatory implementation of **Azure Immutable Blob Storage** configured with Write Once, Read Many (WORM) policies.<sup>5</sup> This feature, which ensures data retention in a non-erasable and non-rewritable format, is compliant with stringent regulatory requirements typically governing financial services (e.g., SEC Rule 17a-4).<sup>6</sup>

By utilizing Azure's WORM capability, MZHub transforms its basic storage layer into a **compliant digital preservation repository**. This is a necessary and powerful feature for the Government of India, as it inherently meets the prerequisite for institutional cultural heritage archiving and adherence to NDPP standards regarding the authenticity and longevity of digital records.<sup>7</sup>

#### Orchestration Layer (Azure Functions)

Azure Functions provide the serverless compute necessary for the event-driven workflow.<sup>17</sup> The process initiates when a new document is uploaded to the ingress Blob Storage container, triggering an Azure Function.<sup>18</sup> This function orchestrates the workflow, calling the Document Intelligence API for analysis.<sup>18</sup>

The reliance on serverless design provides simplified, automatic scaling capabilities, crucial for handling variable processing load from large manuscript collections.<sup>8</sup> Furthermore, the operational cost is calculated based on function execution time, measured in milliseconds, rather than continuous resource consumption.<sup>8</sup> This usage-based billing model provides significantly lower costs, demonstrating estimated savings of approximately 75% compared to running scaled-up VM environments for comparable tasks.<sup>9</sup> This efficiency ensures a highly competitive Cost Per Document Processed (CPDP), demonstrating strong long-term Return on Investment (ROI) and fiscal responsibility.<sup>19</sup>

### C. Quality Assurance and Indexing Layer

A subsequent Azure Function handles the raw JSON output from Document Intelligence. This function is responsible for initial transcription validation, application of the Orthographic Fidelity Index, and integration of mandatory preservation metadata (see Section V).

#### Validation through Vector Search (RAG Architecture)

For advanced validation and semantic verification, the transcribed text is chunked and vectorized using embedding models.<sup>21</sup> These vector embeddings, which capture the semantic meaning of the text, are stored in Azure AI Search.<sup>22</sup> This implementation creates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This approach enables the system to perform complex contextual similarity searches, moving beyond basic character-level accuracy checks to verify the linguistic plausibility and consistency of extracted phrases, which is crucial for highly fragmented or ambiguous manuscript content.<sup>21</sup>

Table 1 details the core components chosen for the pipeline, emphasizing their technical necessity and alignment with compliance goals.

| --- | --- | --- |

## IV. Implementation and Deployment Roadmap (T-Minus 18 Months)

The implementation strategy follows a structured AI lifecycle, beginning with governance and culminating in production deployment and MLOps capability.

### A. Phase 1: Strategic Alignment and Data Governance (Months 1-3)

This phase focuses on critical readiness assessment, aligning technical goals with institutional and governmental requirements, and defining specific use cases.<sup>23</sup> A primary activity is stakeholder alignment with local manuscript custodians and MeitY liaisons to establish ethical and legal frameworks that recognize and protect Indigenous Knowledge and intellectual property.<sup>24</sup>

Crucially, this phase acts as a fundamental phase gate where the **Finalized Compliance Blueprint** is designed and approved. Detailed analysis of GoI standards is performed, ensuring the output transcription JSON schema is architected to incorporate mandated preservation standards, including the MeitY-notified **eGOVPID Metadata Dictionary & Schema** and **PROPeR (Production of Preservable e-Records)**.<sup>7</sup> The success metric for this phase is the approval of this documented MeitY Standard adherence plan, proving that regulatory compliance is the project's foundation, not an ancillary task.<sup>23</sup>

Data governance frameworks must also be finalized to ensure community control over data dissemination, adhering to the principles of Indigenous data sovereignty, particularly those outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP Article 31).<sup>24</sup>

### B. Phase 2: Infrastructure Design and Pre-Training (Months 4-7)

Following strategic approval, the core Azure serverless architecture is deployed, including Blob Storage, Azure Functions, and the Document Intelligence Resource.<sup>17</sup> A non-negotiable activity is the configuration and third-party audit of the **Immutable Blob Storage WORM policies** to establish the foundation of data integrity, directly satisfying long-term archival needs.<sup>5</sup>

A specialized component is dedicated to developing the **Metadata Harvesting and Transformation** Azure Function. This non-standard function is necessary to take the raw Document Intelligence JSON output, enrich it with contextual data, and structure it exactly according to the stringent MeitY schemas.<sup>4</sup> This specialized function ensures compliance _at the point of extraction_, making the resulting data immediately valuable and preservable in the national digital infrastructure. Concurrently, the labor-intensive process of creating highly accurate, labeled ground truth data for low-resource scripts begins.<sup>10</sup>

### C. Phase 3: Model Development and Validation (Months 8-13)

This phase involves the core machine learning activities. The Document Intelligence Custom Neural Models are fine-tuned and adapted using the specialized, labeled datasets.<sup>4</sup> Optimization focuses specifically on improving performance for targeted archaic orthographies and complex script mixtures (e.g., Devanagari variants not universally supported by off-the-shelf models).<sup>27</sup>

Validation moves beyond traditional metrics. While CER and WER provide baseline data, rigorous testing requires the calculation of **Exact Match Rate (EMR) and F1 Score** for structured extraction elements to ensure the reliability of the output data for database ingestion.<sup>28</sup> Furthermore, an ethical review is performed, including systematic bias detection and dedicated testing for the previously identified LLM error of temporal conflation, ensuring the models do not inadvertently introduce historical inaccuracies.<sup>3</sup>

### D. Phase 4: Production Deployment and MLOps (Months 14-18)

The scalable production pipeline is fully operationalized, including automated error handling and monitoring. A critical element of institutional readiness is **Capacity Building**.<sup>29</sup> Comprehensive training is provided for local preservation partners and custodial staff on MLOps procedures, data governance, and the use of the Document Intelligence Studio for iterative model refinement.<sup>13</sup> The final milestones include establishing a continuous process for policy maintenance and infrastructure refreshment, ensuring the long-term viability mandated by digital preservation programs.<sup>7</sup>

## V. Impact Assessment, Compliance, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The success of the MZHub Transcription & OCR Proposal is measured across three orthogonal dimensions: technical fidelity, fiscal responsibility, and governmental compliance/societal value.

### A. Technical and Accuracy KPIs (Researcher Focus)

For heritage texts, standard OCR metrics are insufficient.<sup>3</sup> MZHub commits to advanced metrics that reflect the project's high academic and linguistic standards:

- **Exact Match Rate (EMR):** This quantitative measure determines the percentage of key extracted fields (e.g., entity names, dates) that precisely match the ground truth.<sup>28</sup> EMR is essential for validating the extraction quality necessary for database integration and knowledge mining.
- **F1 Score:** As the harmonic mean of precision and recall, the F1 Score quantifies the model's ability to balance correctness (precision) with completeness (recall).<sup>28</sup> This metric is invaluable when dealing with semi-structured and unstructured manuscripts, where layouts are highly variable.
- **Orthographic Fidelity Index (OFI):** A custom internal metric designed to measure the rate of LLM-induced historical inaccuracies, specifically assessing instances of temporal conflation or anachronistic element insertion.<sup>3</sup> Monitoring the OFI ensures the preservation of linguistic history, aligning the service with advanced digital humanities standards.

### B. Financial and Operational KPIs (Investor Focus)

The serverless architecture guarantees a sustainable operational model that appeals directly to investors by minimizing capital expenditure and maximizing scalability.

- **Return on Investment (ROI):** Measures the overall profitability derived from the digitization investment, quantifying the long-term benefits of accessible data versus the initial infrastructural outlay.<sup>19</sup>
- **Cost Per Document Processed (CPDP):** Quantifies the operational cost efficiency achieved via the Azure Functions-based FaaS model versus legacy manual transcription or VM-based processing models.<sup>9</sup> The operational goal is to achieve and sustain a measurable reduction of 75% in long-term processing costs, ensuring the economic viability required for national scale projects.<sup>9</sup>
- **Productivity and Agility Gain:** Measured by the accelerated throughput rate (time required for ingestion-to-indexed data) compared to prior manual or semi-automated processes.<sup>19</sup>

### C. Compliance and Societal Impact KPIs (Government Focus)

MZHub views regulatory alignment not merely as a requirement but as a core competitive differentiator, transforming the service into a compliant national partner.

- **WORM Policy Audit Rate:** Quarterly verification that all ingested master files are successfully protected under Azure Immutable Blob Storage policies.<sup>6</sup> This is essential for the MeitY requirements regarding the long-term integrity and authenticity of digital preservation records.<sup>7</sup>
- **eGOVPID Metadata Completion Rate:** Percentage of transcribed records that successfully incorporate the mandatory MeitY metadata schema.<sup>7</sup> Adherence to standards for e-Governance, such as the Metadata and Data Digitization Standards (MDDS), ensures seamless interoperability of data and alignment with national standardization objectives.<sup>25</sup>
- **Accessibility Index Increase (AII):** Quantifies the percentage increase in cultural heritage materials made accessible online or virtually to researchers and the public.<sup>32</sup> This metric measures the project's success in achieving the broader objective of heritage engagement and outreach.<sup>33</sup>
- **Community Control Assurance Rate (CCAR):** A governance KPI that tracks quarterly verification that access policies and licensing structures reflect the explicit consent and control exercised by the source community or custodial institution, aligning with the principles of Indigenous data sovereignty.<sup>24</sup> This commitment ensures that the project adheres to ethical, decolonial digitization practices, fostering trust necessary for FaithTech projects.

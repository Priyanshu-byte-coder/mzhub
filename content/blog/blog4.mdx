# Digital Commerce Archiving Proposal: Building the Central Knowledge Archive on Azure

## 1\. Executive Summary: Archiving for Redemptive Intelligence

### 1.1 Project Overview and Strategic Alignment

The MZHub Digital Commerce Archiving Project proposes the deployment of the MZHub Central Knowledge Archive-a highly governed, scalable cloud data infrastructure designed to convert high-volume, volatile digital commerce data into reliable, structured business intelligence. E-commerce organizations generate massive amounts of data; however, reports indicate that up to 64% of organizations cite poor data quality as their top integrity challenge.<sup>1</sup> This project addresses this systemic failure by establishing a dedicated, robust data pipeline and analytical store.

The technical core of the infrastructure is founded on the modern Azure Lakehouse pattern, utilizing Azure Data Factory (ADF) for incremental data ingestion, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) for multi-tiered archiving, and Azure Synapse Analytics for knowledge synthesis. This architecture aligns with MZHub's strategic mission, ensuring that the technology built is redemptive and grounded in ethical practices.<sup>2</sup> By enforcing rigorous data governance in the processing layers, the architecture provides a foundational prerequisite for ethical AI, guaranteeing that models trained on this clean, governed dataset produce results aligned with the organization's moral framework.

### 1.2 Funding Request and Value Proposition

This proposal seeks \$150,000 in free Azure credits to fund the critical compute and storage components necessary for infrastructure deployment and data migration. Specifically, these funds will be allocated toward compute-intensive Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) operations carried out by ADF and Azure Synapse Spark pools, as well as cost-optimized long-term data preservation.

The design utilizes highly efficient mechanisms such as Azure Data Factory's Change Data Capture (CDC) for low-latency, incremental data processing <sup>3</sup> and strategic application of the ADLS Gen2 Archive Tier for long-term retention.<sup>4</sup> This deliberate design choice demonstrates proactive fiscal diligence, proving that MZHub is building a system optimized for long-term sustainability and cost control. The resulting system will directly address the pervasive industry challenge of fragmented data, leading to demonstrable improvements in operational metrics such as forecasting accuracy (Demand Planning) and reduction in overall storage expenditure through intelligent tiered archiving.

## 2\. Problem & Solution: Bridging the SKU-to-Knowledge Gap

### 2.1 The Challenge of Digital Commerce Data Deluge in FaithTech

Digital commerce platforms, particularly those serving the FaithTech sector, face unique data challenges that prevent the conversion of raw transactional data (SKUs) into strategic knowledge.

#### The Data Quality and Trust Deficit

The sheer volume and velocity of digital transactions result in complex, often siloed data streams.<sup>1</sup> MZHub's current raw data landscape suffers from fragmentation, which includes inconsistent product categorization, incomplete customer journey records, and missing lineage metadata. This contributes to the broad industry challenge where data quality undermines confidence in business intelligence.<sup>1</sup> Without a formalized data governance framework, this low-quality foundation risks corrupting strategic decision-making and eroding consumer trust, which is paramount for FaithTech services.

#### Volatility of Seasonal and Cyclical Demand

The demand for religious goods and services is highly sensitive to seasonal and cyclical religious calendars, meaning that trends are often predictable only over multi-year horizons.<sup>5</sup> Accurate demand prediction, which is essential for optimizing inventory and supply chain management, requires sophisticated analysis of historical trends spanning several years.<sup>6</sup> Current siloed systems fail to provide the governed, normalized historical depth necessary for building the robust predictive models required for effective demand planning.<sup>7</sup> The inability to access and analyze this depth of historical data directly impedes market competitiveness during high-stakes religious seasons.

#### The Knowledge Extraction Barrier (Latent Variables)

MZHub's core strategic goals necessitate moving beyond simple transactional reporting (e.g., how many SKUs sold) to understanding deeper, non-transactional metrics, or latent variables, such as user engagement, perceived value, trust, and donation propensity.<sup>8</sup> Extracting these insights is impossible using raw, complex transactional databases. It requires sophisticated data modeling, specifically Dimensional Modeling, which aggregates, summarizes, and relates disparate data points into a business-friendly structure.<sup>10</sup> The current structure acts as a knowledge extraction barrier, preventing the generation of actionable strategic intelligence vital for mission advancement.

### 2.2 The Proposed Solution: The MZHub Central Knowledge Archive

The Central Knowledge Archive provides a systematic solution to these challenges by implementing a state-of-the-art, tiered data management system.

#### Holistic Data Governance via Medallion Architecture

The solution replaces ad-hoc, siloed storage with a unified, high-quality data foundation based on the recommended Azure Medallion Architecture.<sup>11</sup> This architecture provides three distinct, quality-controlled layers-Bronze, Silver, and Gold-ensuring data flows incrementally and progressively improves in structure and quality.<sup>12</sup> This rigorous flow guarantees Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) properties for all data transformations.

#### Bronze Layer for Archival Compliance and Immutable Storage

The Bronze layer receives all raw data streams exactly as they arrive from source systems. This layer is crucial for maintaining immutable archival records, satisfying future audit requirements, and preserving data for potential future use cases, such as training next-generation machine learning models with original, unprocessed source data.<sup>13</sup> All raw data is ingested into the lowest-cost Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Archive tiers <sup>4</sup> after initial ingestion, ensuring maximum compliance with minimum storage cost.

#### Gold Layer for Strategic Knowledge Synthesis

The most significant value proposition is achieved in the Gold layer, where raw SKU data is transformed into highly structured analytical formats (Fact and Dimension Tables).<sup>14</sup> This transformation process follows a strict causal chain: **Raw SKU Data (Bronze)** → undergoes **Cleansing and Validation (Silver)** → results in **Fact/Dimension Tables (Gold)** → which are used for **Latent Scoring (ML Integration)** → leading directly to **Actionable Strategy**. The stability and structure of the Gold layer facilitate rapid querying and the integration of advanced Machine Learning (ML) insights, enabling the move from simple sales reporting to critical strategic intelligence on user trust and donation potential.<sup>8</sup> The failure to adequately cleanse data in the Silver layer would directly corrupt the subsequent latent scoring models, proving that rigorous data structuring is essential for generating reliable strategic output.

## 3\. Technical Architecture (Cloud Stack): The Azure Lakehouse Blueprint

The MZHub Central Knowledge Archive utilizes the Azure ecosystem to implement a robust, performant, and cost-optimized data lakehouse pattern.

### 3.1 Architectural Philosophy: The Medallion Data Lakehouse Pattern

The architecture is fundamentally based on the Medallion Data Lakehouse pattern (Bronze → Silver → Gold) implemented on Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2).<sup>11</sup> This tiered approach is engineered to separate compute from storage and to enable optimal cost management. By defining quality boundaries, compute resources (Azure Synapse/ADF) only need to interact heavily with the refined Silver and Gold data, while the high volume of raw data resides in the low-cost ADLS Gen2 archival tiers.<sup>4</sup>

### 3.2 Data Ingestion and Integration Layer (Bronze)

#### ETL/ELT Tooling and Incremental Loading

Azure Data Factory (ADF) serves as the enterprise-grade orchestration and ELT engine. To maximize efficiency and minimize data movement costs, the system utilizes the native Change Data Capture (CDC) capability provided by ADF.<sup>3</sup> This methodology monitors source databases, such as Azure SQL Managed Instance, and identifies only the delta data (inserted, updated, or deleted rows) since the last execution.<sup>15</sup> This implementation, specifically leveraging the ADF top-level CDC factory resource, allows for continuous data processes rather than relying solely on less efficient batch-only pipelines, which is a key technical optimization demonstrating deep proficiency in Azure capabilities.<sup>3</sup>

#### Long-Term Archiving and Tiering

The Bronze layer uses ADLS Gen2 as its landing zone, with granular management of access tiers to enforce cost discipline.<sup>13</sup> Policy management automatically transitions data post-ingestion: data that may require recent reprocessing moves to the Cool Tier (subject to a 30-day early deletion period), while compliant, long-term audit data is moved to the Archive Tier (180-day early deletion period, lowest storage cost).<sup>4</sup> The use of the Archive tier ensures that original, raw data is preserved economically for future compliance or deep historical analysis.<sup>13</sup>

### 3.3 Data Processing and Validation Layer (Silver)

The Silver layer is responsible for crucial data quality, standardization, and resilience operations, resolving the challenge of fragmented, siloed source data.<sup>1</sup>

#### Schema Governance and Drift Management

A crucial technical requirement is managing schema evolution, or "schema drift," which is endemic to high-volume transactional systems.<sup>16</sup> ADF pipelines incorporate sophisticated routines for schema versioning, ensuring that multiple schema iterations can coexist and that backward compatibility is enforced.<sup>17</sup> This resilience involves defining default values for newly introduced columns and avoiding abrupt alterations to established data types, thereby minimizing operational disruptions. Furthermore, continuous pipeline validation checks are scheduled to compare source and sink schemas at each step, ensuring integrity and triggering automated alerts if structural changes are detected.<sup>16</sup> By preventing pipeline breaks and ensuring dimensional data stability, this governance process is positioned not merely as a compliance exercise but as a performance multiplier for the entire analytical infrastructure.

### 3.4 Knowledge and Presentation Layer (Gold)

#### Cloud Data Warehousing and Dimensional Modeling

The Gold layer utilizes Azure Synapse Analytics (Dedicated SQL Pools) as the primary engine for high-speed Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) querying and Business Intelligence (BI). Data in this layer is rigorously structured using the Star Schema dimensional modeling technique.<sup>14</sup> This architecture separates quantitative, additive measurements into Fact Tables (e.g., Fact_Sales, Fact_Donation) from descriptive context stored in denormalized Dimension Tables (e.g., Dim_Product, Dim_Customer).<sup>10</sup> This model simplifies complex datasets, minimizes redundancy, and significantly improves query performance for business analysts.<sup>19</sup> Dimensional modeling is the foundational bridge required to translate messy transactional data into intuitive, high-speed insights for decision-makers.<sup>10</sup>

#### Advanced Analytics and Intelligence Integration

The architecture facilitates seamless integration with advanced analytics capabilities. Azure Synapse is natively integrated with Azure Machine Learning (AML).<sup>20</sup> ML models, trained on clean Silver layer data to derive complex latent scores (such as "Donation Propensity" or "Trust Index"), are registered and deployed. The Synapse PREDICT function allows these scores to be inferred directly on the Gold layer customer data without the need to move large datasets out of the Synapse environment for scoring.<sup>21</sup> This derived intelligence is materialized as attributes within dimension tables (e.g., adding Trust_Index_Score to Dim_Customer), enabling immediate utilization by standard BI tools for advanced segmentation and strategic planning.

## 4\. Implementation Roadmap: Phased Data Infrastructure Deployment

The deployment of the MZHub Central Knowledge Archive follows a disciplined, multi-phase roadmap designed to manage complexity, mitigate risk, and ensure alignment between technical delivery and business objectives.

### 4.1 Phase 1: Planning, Discovery, and Requirements Analysis (Month 1-3)

The initial phase focuses on defining the strategic objectives, compliance requirements, and operational Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including specific FinOps metrics.<sup>22</sup> This involves comprehensive stakeholder engagement with executives, IT, finance, and end-users to gather precise functional and technical requirements. A Current State Assessment is performed to inventory existing data sources-including CRMs, ERPs, and legacy files-and evaluate current data quality and integration challenges.<sup>1</sup>

### 4.2 Phase 2: Architecture Design and Modeling (Month 4-6)

Core Azure infrastructure, including ADLS Gen2 and Synapse Workspaces, is provisioned, alongside the establishment of security protocols and role-based access control. The critical task is the development of the detailed logical and physical Star Schemas. This design meticulously maps source entities (SKUs, customers, transactions) to the standardized Gold layer Fact and Dimension tables.<sup>14</sup> This period ensures the architecture is sound and prepared to handle the integration of future advanced analytics models.

### 4.3 Phase 3: ETL/ELT Development and Data Integration (Month 7-12)

The data integration pipelines are constructed using Azure Data Factory. Priority is given to implementing Change Data Capture (CDC) for all high-volume source systems, a critical measure to minimize data movement and reduce associated compute costs.<sup>3</sup> The Silver Layer logic is developed to handle data cleansing, standardization, and sophisticated management of schema drift, including the implementation of schema versioning for backward compatibility.<sup>16</sup> The extensive development phase aligns with standard industry timelines for complex data warehouse and lakehouse deployments.<sup>24</sup>

### 4.4 Phase 4: Testing, Validation, and User Acceptance (Month 13-15)

Rigorous testing is performed to validate the data accuracy, completeness, and referential integrity across all three Medallion layers.<sup>22</sup> Performance and stress testing are crucial, particularly within Azure Synapse SQL Pools, where query optimization, distribution key selection, and index tuning are finalized. Efficiency testing ensures auto-scaling policies respond adequately to demand fluctuations, particularly leading into peak seasonal periods, ensuring resource adequacy without over-provisioning.<sup>5</sup> Business analysts conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to confirm the Gold layer data is usable and reliable for BI reporting.

### 4.5 Phase 5: Deployment, Go-Live, and Optimization (Month 16 onwards)

Following successful UAT, the system undergoes production cutover, and end-users receive training. A key component of this final phase is continuous FinOps calibration. Cloud deployment is not a singular event, but a continuous effort toward efficiency.<sup>24</sup> Automated monitoring tracks resource utilization (CPU, memory, storage) and audits FinOps KPIs, such as Showback & Chargeback Accuracy and Granularity of Cost Allocation.<sup>23</sup> Bronze layer data lifecycle policies are actively monitored to ensure rapid transition of archival data to the lowest-cost Archive tiers <sup>4</sup>, proving responsible stewardship of the Azure resources and establishing a scalable financial operating model.

## 5\. Measurable Impact & KPIs: Value Realization and FinOps

The success of the Central Knowledge Archive will be measured across five critical areas, demonstrating both strategic business value and efficient technical operation.

### 5.1 Strategic Business Impact

The archived and modeled data directly supports high-value organizational outcomes. The existence of high-quality, normalized historical data enables significant improvements in inventory and operational planning. The primary metric here is the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the Demand Forecast, where a sustained reduction indicates higher planning efficiency, minimizing excess inventory and associated costs.<sup>6</sup>

Furthermore, the integration of advanced ML models into the Gold layer, achieved via Azure Synapse's native scoring capabilities <sup>21</sup>, allows for the reliable measurement of non-transactional constructs, such as Customer Trust and Donation Propensity.<sup>8</sup> This capability, tracked by the Latent Score Utilization Rate (LSU%), fundamentally changes MZHub's ability to measure its redemptive impact and optimize marketing strategies during critical seasonal purchasing periods.<sup>5</sup>

### 5.2 Technical and Financial (FinOps) Impact

To ensure responsible governance of the cloud environment, technical stability and financial accountability are tracked via rigorous FinOps Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

A common tension in data infrastructure is balancing high data quality (which requires compute investment for cleansing) with low storage cost. The architecture addresses this by tracking the Gold Layer Data Quality Index (DQI) alongside the Archival Tier Utilization Percentage. Maintaining a DQI above 98% ensures business users can trust the data <sup>1</sup>, while aggressively tiering raw data down to Archive (targeting > 70% utilization) demonstrates fiscal efficiency and control over long-term operating costs.<sup>4</sup>

Pipeline efficiency is measured by Pipeline Processing Latency (PPL), where the implementation of ADF CDC is expected to yield substantial reductions in data latency, speeding up decision cycles.<sup>3</sup> Finally, tracking granular FinOps metrics, such as Showback & Chargeback Accuracy <sup>23</sup> and Auto-scaling Efficiency <sup>25</sup>, proves that the organization is building a scalable and auditable financial structure, which is crucial for maximizing the long-term impact of the grant funding.
